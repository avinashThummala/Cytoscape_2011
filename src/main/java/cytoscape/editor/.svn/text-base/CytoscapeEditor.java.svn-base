/**
 *
 * <b>CytoscapeEditor</b> provides a framework for developers to implement specialized, semantics
 * driven graphical
 * editors and incorporate them into Cytoscape.  For example, a developer might build a <em>BioPAX</em>
 * editor whose operations adhere to the semantics of the <em>BioPAX</em> specification.
 * The basic idea of the framework is to provide, on the Cytotoscape side, a set of common operations that
 * all editors would use to interact with the Cytoscape environment.  Such common operations include drag/drop
 * support, mouse event handling, management of CyNetworks and CyNetworkViews, and wrappers for Cytoscape core
 * methods that add and delete Cytoscape nodes and edges.
 * <p>
 * <b>CytoscapeEditor</b> is an interface that specifies common methods which all editors must implement.
 * These methods will be called by methods in the framework.
